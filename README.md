# pyorbit
I'm new to Python, and this repo is just to upload my random codes related to orbital mechanics.
Yeah, I know all the outputs of these codes can be easily searched online or calculated on a phone. But why look at the Î”v chart while playing KSP when you can run a Python program to do the same and never shut the fuck up about it?
